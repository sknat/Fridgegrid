This project is a small Proof of concept website of grocery sharing economy that was developped during the Angelhack Hackathon in San Francisco.
The goal is develop a platform where people can exchange/resell their groceries to the people living next to them.

It uses a very simple architecture (parse.com as a backend), and bootstrap design.

It has been discontinued since.
